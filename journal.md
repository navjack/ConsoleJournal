* 2022/01/20 - 10:23:27 PM - Fixed the python code back to use ``journal.md`` from the current working directory and i changed my alias on my computer to be ``alias journal="(cd /Volumes/ext/journal; python3 "/Volumes/ext/journal/journal.py")"``
* 2022/01/20 - 12:46:35 AM - alias
* 2022/01/20 - 12:30:08 AM - Got rid of the header formatting
* 2022/01/20 - 12:29:29 AM - Would i want to add anything else to this? I'm not sure. Possibly being able to just run 'journal.py my new entry' to make it a one line kind of thing with no further input required.
* 2022/01/20 - 12:27:21 AM - so now we have correct formatting
* 2022/01/20 - 12:24:34 AM - seconds
