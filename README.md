# ConsoleJournal

## What?

First of all, I dont know how to program.

Second of all, this was written mainly by me wrangling around GitHub CoPilot to do my bidding.

My goal with this is to make a simple console based "Journal". I'm unsure of the scope I want from it but simplicity is key. I imagine just pulling up a console window and being like ``journal today i did blah blah blah`` and it saves it into a file with the date and time and simple markdown bullet point formatting. So far it does exactly this.

## To-Do

* Folder or file selector?
* Config file instead of hardcoded pathnames and file names
