# ConsoleJournal

## What?

First of all, I dont know how to program.

Second of all, this was written mainly by me wrangling around GitHub CoPilot to do my bidding.

My goal with this is to make a simple console based "Journal". I'm unsure of the scope I want from it but simplicity is key. I imagine just pulling up a console window and being like ``journal today i did blah blah blah`` and it saves it into a file with the date and time and simple markdown bullet point formatting. So far it does exactly this.

To describe it another way

> org mode or orgzly or obsidian or anything like that is too formal for what i want. i want a dumb as shit thing almost to the point of "this could just be you opening notepad, why aren't you just doing this manually in notepad?"

The journal.md file in this repo is an example of what it outputs.

You need to make changes to the script in order to use this correctly. We use a variable in the code itself to point to the files. Possibly in the future I will change this.
